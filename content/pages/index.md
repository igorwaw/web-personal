#### Why is this site called Too Many Machines?

I'm surrounded by them. I work with virtual machines all the time. If I do some software development, I might use a state machine. I start every day by turning on my coffee machine. There's a  washing machine in my utility room. I myself am a biological machine. 

Also, the domain was available and the previous ones I tried were all taken.
